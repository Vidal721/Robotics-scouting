Robotics Scouter
============
## Version 2020.5.1

Before you use this program at a competition, please ensure that you are using the latest version. Check ther versions file to make sure that you are.

### Installation

If you want to install this software, you need to download the zip file and unzip it, you can do this by right-clicking it and clicking Extract All. Note, that if your school or district has a filter, you may be unable to extract the file. We are currently working on this issue and are hoping to solve it soon

### How to Run

Open the Index.html file to get started. Make sure that you are opening this in your web browser, not your programming software. Remember that the un-programming customization option can only be used once and should be done when you are 100% ready to modify it.

### Basic Usage

The first page you open will be the home page, when you open this you will see a master, and scouter button. If you are the master scouter you will set your information in the program or in the customization stage. Your passowrd and information is not 100% secure so make sure it's not a regular password you use.

### Exporting

When you are ready to hand your data over to the master scouter, click the Export data button. This should place a file named data-XXXXXX.json (with the Xs replaced with randomized numbers) in your Downloads folder. Check your Downloads folder to access the file, but do not alter the content of the file. This file should be sent to the master scouter.

You do not have to reset your data after an export if you wish. Any further exports you complete will still include all your data, however when the master scouter imports your data it will not include any duplicates.

### Master Scouter: Importing and Exporting

As a master scouter, you can import any .json files into the program that have scouting information in them. Upon importing, the data of other scouters will populate your scouting database, and you can use this information to simulate matches, draft picklists, and generate team overviews.

When you export your data, a file named MASTERDUMP-XXXXXX.json will manifest itself in your Downloads folder. This can be renamed whatever you'd like it to be if you wish to keep it for further reference. It is HIGHLY recommended that you export as often as possible to ensure you do not lose your data. You should also keep all scouter data files given to you, as reimporting a batch of files will not produce duplicates and having backups is recommended.
